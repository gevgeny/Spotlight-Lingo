<h1>Spotlight Lingo ðŸŒŽ Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This Privacy Policy outlines how Spotlight Lingo handles user data.

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<b>The extension itself does not collect any personal information or data from its users.</b> We do not store, share, or use any personally identifiable information. However, we do collect the following anonymized data for analytics purposes:
<ol>
  <li><b>Anonymized User ID:</b> A randomly generated identifier that does not allow for personal identification.</li>
  <li><b>Site Information:</b> The site where the extension is active at the moment the event is sent.</li>
  <li><b>Translation Languages:</b> The source translation language and the target translation language selected by the user.</li>
  <li><b>Browser Model and Version:</b> Information about the user's browser type and version.</li>
  <li><b>Browser Timezone:</b> The timezone set in the user's browser.</li>
  <li><b>Operating System:</b> The operating system the user is running.</li>
</ol>

This data is used solely for understanding how the extension is being used and to improve our service. All collected data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify individual users.

<h2>Compliance with Regulations</h2>
Our data collection practices ensure compliance with applicable privacy regulations, including GDPR and other relevant privacy laws. Since we only process anonymized data, no personal data is transferred or stored outside the EU unless required to provide services to non-EU customers.

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly.
