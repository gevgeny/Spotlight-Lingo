  <h1>Subtitle Translator ðŸŒŽ Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  This Privacy Policy outlines how Subtitle Translator handles user data.
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <b>The extension itself does not collect any personal information or data from its users.</b> We do not store, share, or use any personal identifiable information.
  <h2>Data Sent to Third-Party Services</h2>
  We utilize <a href="https://www.simpleanalytics.com">Simple Analytics</a>, a third-party service, to collect anonymous analytics about user activity. This helps us understand how the extension is being used and allows us to improve our service. The data sent to Simple Analytics includes:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Site Information:</b> The site where the extension is active at the moment the event is sent.</li>
    <li><b>Translation Languages:</b> The source translation language and the target translation language selected by the user.</li>
    <li><b>Browser Theme:</b> Information about the user's browser theme (e.g., light or dark mode).</li>
  </ol>
  This data is sent anonymously and cannot be used to identify individual users.

  <h3>Simple Analytics Privacy Measures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>No Personal Data Collection:</b> Simple Analytics does not collect any personal data. All collected data is anonymous and cannot be traced back to an individual user.</li>
    <li><b>Data Encryption:</b> Data stored by Simple Analytics is fully encrypted, ensuring it is protected against unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><b>No Data Selling:</b> Simple Analytics does not sell your data. The collected data is used solely for providing insights into the extension's usage.</li>

  <h2>Compliance with Regulations</h2>
  Our use of Simple Analytics ensures compliance with the strictest privacy regulations, including GDPR and other relevant privacy laws.
